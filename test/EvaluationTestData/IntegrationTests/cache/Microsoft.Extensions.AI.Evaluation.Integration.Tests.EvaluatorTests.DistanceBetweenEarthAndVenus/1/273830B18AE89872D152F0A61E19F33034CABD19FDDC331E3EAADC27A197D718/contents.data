At their closest approach, known as inferior conjunction, Venus can be approximately 24.8 million miles (about 40 million kilometers) from Earth. At their furthest, when they are on opposite sides of the Sun, the distance can be about 162 million miles (approximately 261 million kilometers). These distances can vary slightly due to the elliptical nature of planetary orbits."
