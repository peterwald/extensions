At their closest approach, known as inferior conjunction, Venus can be about 24.8 million miles (40 million kilometers) from Earth. At their furthest, when they are on opposite sides of the Sun, the distance can be about 162 million miles (261 million kilometers). These distances can vary slightly due to the elliptical nature of the planets' orbits."
